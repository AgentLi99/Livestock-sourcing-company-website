# Livestock-sourcing-company-website
This is a website for a livestock soucing company, this multi-page website was built entirely in bootstrap.
The client was a new company who had an idea for sourcing goats and livestock here in Nigeria, he made the major shift from eccomerce sites like jiji.ng to having a website of their own where there customers can buy directly without been at the mercy of a merchant.
